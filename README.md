# Configuration

## Background Images

**Background Wallpaper** is probably one of the best features of the plugin.
This feature will set the background image to the current theme's official wallpaper.

**Important!!** Installing theme assets requires me to corrupt VS-Code by modifying CSS. You will have to use the "Remove Sticker/Background" command to restore VS Code back to supported status before unistalling. I won't show you this message again in the future if you choose to install.
[This plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lehni.vscode-fix-checksums) can remove the annoying `Unsupported` warning.

**Glass Pane effect**

## Stickers

**Show sticker** allows you to control the presence of the cute sticker in the bottom right-hand corner of your IDE.
